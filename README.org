* Description

AAR is a simple tool for archiving small files with AES
cryptography. It's intentionally ignorant of the operating system and
file system. I built it to archive and backup SSH and GnuPG keys
outside of my traditional system backups.

* Obvious Improvements to be Done

- Prevent leaking the key from the process list, `ps -ef`.
- Copy-on-write to avoid potentially damaging the archive.
