AAR is a simple tool for archiving small files with AES
cryptography. It's intentionally ignorant of the operating system and
file system. I built it to archive and backup SSH and GnuPG keys
outside of my traditional system backups.

* Installation

On Linux,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
bmake
#+END_EXAMPLE

On *BSD,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
make
#+END_EXAMPLE

On another POSIX compliant platform,

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cc -o aar -D AAR_OS_POSIX build.c
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Usage



* Obvious TODOs (that may or may not get done)

- Prevent leaking the key from the process list, =ps -ef=.
- Copy-on-write to avoid potentially damaging the archive.
