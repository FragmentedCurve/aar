AAR is a simple tool for archiving small files with AES
cryptography. It's intentionally ignorant of the operating system and
file system. I built it to archive and backup SSH and GnuPG keys outside
of my traditional system backups.


Installation
============

  On Linux,

  ,----
  | bmake
  `----

  On *BSD,

  ,----
  | make
  `----

  On another POSIX compliant platform,

  ,----
  | cc -o aar -D AAR_OS_POSIX build.c
  `----


Usage
=====


Obvious TODOs (that may or may not get done)
============================================

  - Prevent leaking the key from the process list, `ps -ef'.
  - Copy-on-write to avoid potentially damaging the archive.
